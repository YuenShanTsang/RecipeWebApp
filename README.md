# Recipe WebApp
CMP1005 - Advanced Web Development
Final Project
<br /> Using ASP .NET MVC with C#
## Core Idea
Allow users to create, read, update, and delete their recipes easily.
### Ancillary Goals
1. Recipe Search
   <br /> Users can search for API and own created recipes based on keywords.
2. Favorite Recipes
   <br /> Users can mark and unmark recipes as favorite:
   <br /> - User-created recipes will be placed on the top when added to favourite.
   <br /> - Api recipes will be placed on favourite page due to the random generation of recipes, so need to store the data.
   <br /> - Users can sort their favourite recipes according to timestamp or rating.
4. Recipe Rating
   <br /> Users can rate recipes based on their experience with them:
   <br /> - User-created recipes can be rated on the home page.
   <br /> - Api recipes can be rated on the favourite page.
